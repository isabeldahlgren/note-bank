\section*{Induction}

Mathematical induction is a proof technique used to prove patterns.

\subsection*{The need for induction}

Have a look at the following formula.
$$\sum_{k = 1}^n k = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}$$

How could you prove it for every $n \geq 1$?

For starters, you might verify the formula, plugging in a few values for $n$. For example,
$$n = 3: \qquad 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 = \frac{3(3 + 1)}{2}$$

You could work through the calculations for a bunch of other $n$:s. However, your task was to prove it for every possible $n$. You would have to perform the same calculation an infinite number of times.

\subsection*{Inductive proof of the sum formula}
Induction uses some logic to sidestep this problem.

Firstly, you should check that the formula holds for $n = 1$.
$$\sum_{k = 1}^n k = 1 = \frac{1(1 + 1)}{2}$$

Secondly, assume that the formula holds for some particular $n$. For $n + 1$, you get
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k = 1}^{n + 1} k &= \underbrace{1 + ... + n}_{n(n + 1)/2 \text{, by assumption}} + (n + 1) \\
    &= \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + (n + 1) = \frac{n(n + 1) + 2 \cdot (n + 1)}{2}\\
    &= \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2)}{2} = \frac{(n + 1)((n + 1) + 1)}{2} \\
\end{align*}
You might recognise the final expression as the sum formula for $n + 1$.

And now you're done. These two findings actually guarantee that the formula is true for all $n \geq 1$.

Induction can be likened to a domino effect.

\simplequote{If the first domino brick is tipped, and a falling domino brick is heavy enough to tip the next, every domino brick will fall.}

\subsection*{The Principle of Induction}
In general, suppose you want to prove a statement for all $n \geq n_0$, where $n_0$ is some natural number. Let $P(n)$ be shorthand for 'the statement is true for the number $n$'.

An inductive proof involves two steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Base case: show that $P(n_0)$.
    \item Inductive step: show that 'if $P(n)$, then $P(n + 1)$'. The assumption that $P(n)$ is called the inductive hypothesis.
\end{enumerate}
At this stage, you have effectively shown that $P(n)$ for all $n \geq n_0$.

You might come across the Principle of Induction. Loosely speaking, this is the idea that induction works.

\subsection*{Guidelines}
There are may proof techniques out there, but induction may prove useful if:

\begin{itemize}
    \item You want to prove a result about natural numbers.
    \item You find yourself wanting to say 'and so on...'
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Additional material}
In this course, you will use induction to prove formulas, inequalities and divisibility.

But induction can be applied to other kinds of problems too. For example, suppose $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$. Then you could use induction to prove that $$f^n(x) = (-1)^n \cdot n! \cdot x^{-(n + 1)}$$ Can you see how?
